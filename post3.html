      <h1>How I Built My First Portfolio</h1>
      <p class="meta">Published on Jan 15, 2025 | By Tarak</p>

      <p>
        Building my first portfolio was a milestone in my developer journey. 
        I wanted to showcase my skills, projects, and personality in a simple yet professional way.
        This post is all about the process I followed, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I Built a Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        In today's competitive tech world, a resume alone is not enough. 
        Recruiters and clients want to see your <b>actual work</b>. 
        A portfolio allows you to highlight your skills, demonstrate your projects, and 
        leave a strong first impression. For me, it was also about building confidence and 
        having a digital space that truly represents who I am as a developer.
      </p>

      <h2>Choosing the Right Tech Stack</h2>
      <p>
        For the first version, I decided to stick with <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>.
        These technologies are beginner-friendly, yet powerful enough to create a clean and modern website. 
        Later, I plan to rebuild it using <b>React</b> for scalability and <b>Tailwind CSS</b> for faster styling.
      </p>

      <h2>Designing the Layout</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted a minimal, mobile-friendly design. I sketched a wireframe with the following sections:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Home - A short introduction.</li>
        <li>About - Who I am and what I do.</li>
        <li>Skills - My technical stack with progress bars.</li>
        <li>Projects - Links to GitHub and live demos.</li>
        <li>Resume - A PDF download link.</li>
        <li>Contact - A simple form + social links.</li>
        <li>Blog - To share knowledge and tutorials.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Adding Interactivity</h2>
      <p>
        To make the website engaging, I added:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Dark Mode Toggle</b> - Users can switch themes easily.</li>
        <li><b>Smooth Scrolling</b> - Makes navigation feel natural.</li>
        <li><b>Animations</b> - Subtle fade-ins for text and images.</li>
        <li><b>Scroll to Top Button</b> - For quick navigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Deployment Experience</h2>
      <p>
        After finishing the design, I deployed the website using <b>GitHub Pages</b>.
        It was a free and beginner-friendly way to get my site online. 
        I later explored <b>Netlify</b> for advanced features like custom domains and continuous deployment. 
        Seeing my website live for the first time was truly motivating.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
      <p>
        The toughest part was making the website <b>responsive</b>. 
        Using <code>flexbox</code> and <code>media queries</code>, 
        I ensured the layout worked on desktops, tablets, and phones.
        Debugging CSS issues took a lot of time, but I learned how powerful browser developer tools can be.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
      <p>
        If you are planning to build your first portfolio, here are my suggestions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with simple HTML and CSS before jumping into frameworks.</li>
        <li>Focus on content first ‚Äî projects and skills matter more than fancy effects.</li>
        <li>Keep it responsive ‚Äî test on mobile, tablet, and desktop.</li>
        <li>Iterate ‚Äî your portfolio will evolve as you learn new skills.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        1. Start simple - don't overcomplicate your first project.<br>
        2. Focus on readability - a clean design is always better.<br>
        3. Learn by doing - the best way to improve is to build something real.<br>
        4. Consistency matters - small design choices add up.<br>
        5. Feedback helps - share your site and ask for suggestions.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        I plan to add the following features in my next version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A blog system to share coding tutorials and articles.</li>
        <li>A dynamic project gallery with filters.</li>
        <li>Integration with <b>EmailJS</b> for direct contact form submissions.</li>
        <li>SEO improvements to make my site discoverable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>
        My next step is to deploy the portfolio online using <b>GitHub Pages</b> or <b>Netlify</b>. 
        I also want to integrate a blog system where I can share tutorials like this one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building this portfolio gave me confidence as a developer. 
        It not only shows my skills but also my dedication to learning and improving.
        If you haven't built your portfolio yet, <b>start today</b> ‚Äî it's the best project you can make for yourself.
